# React QnA

## Components

### 1. What is a "React Component"?
It's a Javascript function which typically returns HTML (JSX) code that should be displayed.

### 2. What does "component tree" mean?
It means that you have a root node which then has more components nested beneath it.

### 3. How do you pass data between components?
Via "custom HTML attributes" (better known as "props")

### 4. How can you output dynamic data in React components (i.e. in the returned JSX code)?
You can only use single curly braces (opening & closing) with any  JS expression between them.

You can't put block statements (e.g. if statements) between those curly braces but you can output any result of any JS expression by using this special feature.
